==========

Experimental bulk export of Cyclemeter's Meter.db file to GPX files for import using Strava, Endomondo, or other workout applications.


Very experimental at this point, with rudimentary GPX export from Cyclementer coordinates with "nearest recorded point" altitude.

Supports:
- GPX export
- Simple elevation profiles
 
Doesn't support:
- GPX 1.1
- Heartrate, power, or other sensor data (Need samples!)
- TCX export (Need samples!)
- Abvio extension information
- Metadata export (Name, equipment, activity type, etc)
- Better elevation profiling
- Better point smoothing
